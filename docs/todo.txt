Bugs to fix:

- Invalid commands while in visual mode should beep and stay in visual mode.
- Typing while in insert mode at cursor reaches end of screen, scroll causes cursor to move.
- Ensure smooth scrolling is turned off.
- :dig doesn't bring up the window (it flashes a split second).
- Split text when typing fast after o command.
- Replace mode - fix caret. Can't figure out how to keep block caret.
- Repeating a last change doesn't include text inserted by IDEA using code
  completion.

Requested Functionality to add:

- Show message after shifting lines with :< or :>
- / and ? as command operators
